INCOMPLETE WOLFTEAM SERVER FILES

Those files were created by b6ooy who is now retired from the WolfTeam cheats scene.
They we're at first created for his own private server (WTClassic) but he gave those to M4L1F1C since he knew he wouldn't finish this project.

What is left to work on to be able to run a server with those files ?
- Not all packets are done (about 30% left)
- Create your own SQL structure
- PHP files


Credits :
- b6ooy (dev)
- M4L1F1C (the guy who publicly released those files)
